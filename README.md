# Judgement Bot
Say someone posts feet into your discord channel. Its not technically against the rules, but some users believe that feet are gross and want to do something about it. enter judgement bot:

## How does it work? 

1) A admin imitates the judgement proccess with ^jt (username) (reason[optional]). A poll begins on the "users" fate. I have spent some time making sure all media links are handled correctly here so you can have anything as the reason! links, gifs, pictures, ect, *but not stickers.....yet* 

2) users have 15 seconds to vote if they want to user to be muted or not. it uses reactions to gauge this.

3) if the up arrow wins, the user is muted for one minute (configurable with the ^sm command) or if they "survive" the vote the bot says "mute averted"
